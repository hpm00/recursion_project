# Recursion Project

Project from theOdinProject

Assignment 1:

Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].

Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively.


Assignment 2:

Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
